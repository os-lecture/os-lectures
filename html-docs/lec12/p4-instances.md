### Dining philosophers problem
- 5 philosophers sit around a round table
- There are 5 forks on the table
- Put a fork between every two philosophers
- Philosopher actions include thinking and eating
- You need to use the left and right forks at the same time when eating
- Put the two forks back in place while thinking

How to ensure that the actions of philosophers are carried out in an orderly manner?
Such as: no one will never get a fork

### Dining Philosophers Problem -- Scheme 4
<!-- https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43237362/article/details/104712647 AND type semaphore -->

The AND-type semaphore set refers to the semaphore operation when multiple resources are required at the same time and each type occupies one resource.

When a piece of code needs to obtain two or more critical resources at the same time, it may occur that each thread obtains part of the critical resources and waits for the rest of the critical resources. Each thread will "not give in", resulting in a deadlock.

A basic idea to solve this problem is: apply for multiple critical resources required by the entire code in a primitive, or allocate all of them to it, or allocate none of them to it. This is the basic idea of AND-type semaphore sets.

         else {
              Place the thread in the waiting queue associated with the first Si
              found with Si < 1
         }

### Dining Philosophers Problem -- Scheme 5
Scheme 5 not only has no deadlock, but also can obtain the maximum degree of parallelism for any philosopher. The algorithm uses an array `state` to keep track of whether each philosopher is eating, thinking, or hungry (trying to pick up a fork). A philosopher is only allowed to enter the eating state if both neighbors are not eating.

Each thread runs the function `philosopher` as the main code, while the other functions `take_forks`, `put_forks` and `test` are just normal functions, not separate threads.

### The Reader-Writer Problem
- Two types of users sharing data
   - Reader: Read only does not modify data
   - Writer: read and modify data
- Read and write to shared data
   - multiple: "read-read" -- allow
   - Single: "read-write" -- mutual exclusion
   - Single: "write-write" -- mutual exclusion

### The Reader-Writer Problem
- Reader first strategy
    - As long as a reader is reading the state, subsequent readers can directly enter
    - If readers keep coming in, writers are starving
  - Writer first policy
    - Writers should perform write operations as soon as there are writers ready
    - Readers are starving if writers are continuously ready

### Reader-Writer Problem -- Scenario 1
Describe each constraint with a semaphore
- Semaphore WriteMutex: Controls the mutual exclusion of read and write operations, initialized to 1
- Reader count Rcount: the number of readers who are reading, initialized to 0
- Semaphore CountMutex: Controls the mutually exclusive modification of the reader count, initialized to 1
